# GeoNotif: Android Application

GeoNotif is a location-based task manager application using which users can add tasks they
need to do at particular geographical locations. The app, which runs as a service, will remind
users of their incomplete tasks based on their current location. The app will also allow users to
create groups for activities and manage task lists. It will handle the shared data across users in
these groups and distinguish between individual and group tasks. Finally, GeoNotif will reward
users for items they check off their lists by providing the limited ability to assign tasks to other
users in their network
